Wiring:
    Pedal #1:   R3 -> Button -> C9     Alt
    Pedal #2:   R1 -> Button -> C15    Shift
    Pedal #3:   R3 -> Button -> C11    Space
    Pedal #4:   R6 -> Button -> C0     Ctrl

Wiring colors and labels:
    Blue:   Matrix row wires,    board side,  labeled: Rx  (x = row number)
    Green:  Matrix row wires,    button side, labeled: BxR (x = button ID)
    Red:    Matrix column wires, board side,  labeled: Cx  (x = column number)
    Orange: Matrix column wires, button side, labeled: BxC (x = button ID)

Solved issues:
    * Board sends spurious XF86Sleep and XF86PowerOff key events when pressing
      Pedal #3. Something is shorting somewhere. These keys weren't on the plastic
      keyboard matrix, I don't know what pads they correspond to.
      Scraped the shit out of the gaps between the pads, hope it helps.
      I also temporarily disabled the Sleep/PowerOff shortcuts in KDE Plasma.
     Solution: Scraping/cleaning seems to have worked for now. More scraping/cleaning
      in case the problem returns. And hopefully without ripping off more traces.
      Commands I used for checking spurious events:
        $ tastenbrett
        $ xev | grep keysym

    * Accidentally ripped the R6 pad off the board while trying to solve the first issue.
      Wire was reinforced with CA glue to avoid ripping off pads like C11 before,
      however it didn't help. So Pedal #4 doesn't work anymore.
      B4R/R6 wire needs reattachment to some newly scraped copper around R6,
      or worst case move the wire to pad R4. (LeftCtrl -> RightCtrl)
     Solution: Reattached the wire to the stub of the torn off R6 trace using a large
      solder blob and reinforced the connection with CA glue. If this falls off,
      the wire goes straight to R4.
